Between life and death there is a library.

It's a place that exists in the space between worlds, filled with all the books that contain all the lives you could have lived. Every book tells the story of how your life might have unfolded if you had made different choices.

In this library, you have the chance to experience these alternative lives, to see how things might have been different if you had chosen another path, another career, another love, another way of being.

The library appears to different people in different ways. To some, it might appear as a small village library. To others, as a vast, multi-level institution. But in every case, it is a place of infinite possibility, where every book represents a life unlived.

This is the story of one woman's journey through that library, and her discovery of what it truly means to live...

The fate of British Cycling changed one day in 2003.

The organization, which was the governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain, had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director. At the time, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity. Since 1908, British riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic Games, and they had fared even worse in cycling's biggest race, the Tour de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.

In fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear.

Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as "the aggregation of marginal gains," which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do...

About 13.5 billion years ago, matter, energy, time and space came into being in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our universe is called physics.

About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called chemistry.

About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. The story of organisms is called biology.

About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures. The subsequent development of these human cultures is called history.

Three important revolutions shaped the course of history: the Cognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago...

Evelyn Hugo was a reclusive Hollywood icon, and I was a nobody.

I was a staff writer at a magazine called Vivant, and I was absolutely, categorically, unquestionably not the right person to be doing a cover story on her.

But there I was, standing in front of her penthouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, about to interview one of the most famous women who ever lived.

How did this happen? you might wonder. How does a woman in her early thirties with a mediocre career, a car that sometimes doesn't start, and a very small savings account get the chance to interview Evelyn Hugo?

A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows.

In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul...

The memory was formed when I was five, just before I turned six, from a story my father told in such detail that I and my brothers and sister had each walked away with our own version of the event.

This is how I remember it: I am five years old, wearing a pink dress, standing in a field of bitter roots. The sun is setting behind the mountain, and the sky is dark. My father is next to me. He takes my small hand in his large one and says, "Tara, can you see that peak?"

The peak is the mountain that overlooks our house, Buck's Peak. I can see it.

"That's the peak where God talks to men," he says. "That peak is holy."
